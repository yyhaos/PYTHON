Run main.py in python 3.6.5 
Need pygame

Problems :
1 
when using PyInstaller to package the main.py, the software size is about 667MB which is too huge.

try to use " from ... import ...  " instead of just " import " , but it does not work. Still 667MB

remove numpy and try " pyinstaller -F "  gets 225MB

Going to do:
1
a timer
2 Done
BGM & sound
3
ai
4
Some titles
